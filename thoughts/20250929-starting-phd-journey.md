# Starting my dual-PhD journey!

After a great trip to Denmark, Sweden and Norway this summer (risking my life, see picture below), my dual-PhD journey finally started this month! I'm very excited to take a deep dive into the realms of information retrieval and open government, but before that, let's say something about myself.

## Nice to meet you!

I have a bachelors' degree in Information Sciences and a master's degree in Computer Science, both obtained in Amsterdam. During my studies, I've developed a keen interest for artificial intelligence, especially related to the developments of generative AI. I wrote my bachelor thesis about publishing open government data according to the FAIR data principles. After that, together with Maarten Marx, I built a search engine for governmental documents (at the time of writing about 20 million+ pages of text), called WooGLe. This project gave rise to the kickoff of the [ICAI OpenGov Lab](https://www.opengov.nl/blog/2025/05/06/icai-opengov-lab-kickoff-at-lab42/) in May 2025! Very cool, because they gave me the opportunity to bridge two of my interests and study information retrieval in a governmental context!

## A dual-PhD? How does that work?

It means that, while doing research, I also work in an advisory role for the [Rijksorganisatie voor Informatiehuishouding](https://www.rvihh.nl/) within the Ministry of Interior and Kingdom Relations. In potential, this means that we (as OpenGov team) can make serious impact on the (information)relation between government and citizens! The purpose of this collaboration is to solve actual problems with our research and vice versa; the advisory work should serve as a constant stream of input for interesting research areas.

## Research topics (AI for Open Government, Information Retrieval, Large Language Models)

I recently read Arre Zuurmond's report ['Dwars door de Orde'](https://www.open-overheid.nl/documenten/2025/04/16/dwars-door-de-orde) and some of his insights illustrate the problem really well:
- The Dutch government produces more and more information, but does not know what to share or keep. As a consequence, the government can't seem to find information back and information constantly 'gets lost'. 
- Part of the problem is that every governmental body (provinces, municipalities, and so on) is forced to create their own norms and practices.
- The Wet open overheid (Woo, Freedom of Information Act) obliges the government to actively publish information, but simply publishing information without context is a 'wassen neus' (without meaning). 
- The information landscape of the government is best described by spaghetti. Data is locked in applications and everything is connected with interfaces, instead of a central information layer.

The information retrieval challenges seem to be twofold:
1. We need tools to help governmental bodies find the information they need, for example for replying to information requests (supply side);
2. We need tools to strengthen the information position of citizens, helping them to navigate through the piles of governmental information (demand side).

Years ago, the field of information retrieval was dominated by optimizing traditional search engines, like Google (keyword or semantic search). In the meantime, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupted the field and search experiences. Instead of documents, people are now looking for direct answers in natural language, with tools like chatbots and RAG-systems. These are very exciting and have lots of potential applications in governmental context. We must be, however, also cautious, as these systems also introduce new challenges. What if LLMs don't tell the truth (hallucinations)? What biases are introduced in the models during training? What happens with the data (questions, documents, sensitive information) the user inputs? How easily can LLMs be tricked in giving information it shouldn't? How can we know and explain what is going on in these language models? How do they make decisions? In my research, I hope to contribute to solving the information needs for both governments and citizens, while actively taking into account these fundamental questions.

## "De kop is eraf!"

For non-Dutch speakers: it means that I have started, but literally it means that "the head is off". I'm looking forward to the next steps! Feel free to contact me with questions and suggestions :)
