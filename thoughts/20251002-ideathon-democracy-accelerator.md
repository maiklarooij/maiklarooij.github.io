# We won the Democracy Accelerator Ideathon!

Damiaan and I participted in the "Democracy Accelerator", an ideathon organized by the [Open State Foundation](https://openstate.eu) and the [Social Technology Lab](https://socialtechnologylab.nl/). In a few hours, we had to work out an idea that boosts democracy and give a pitch to a jury.

Our project: “Quote of Context,” by me, Arjan Haring, Karel Geraedts, and Eva Barneveld, a.k.a. the Ministry of Context. We pitched a tool that puts political quotes (e.g., from the House of Representatives) back into their broader context. The concept: matching fragments circulating on social media or WhatsApp with the original transcript and video of the meeting. The fragment is then enriched by also making reactions from other parties, additions, or corrections from the debate visible. In the future, we can also experiment with statements made on, for instance, talk shows and adding external sources, such as research reports. This creates a more complete and reliable picture of public statements.

Our idea got democratically chosen as the best idea! The prize? Guidance and access to contacts by the teams of Open State and the Social Technology Lab to help further develop this idea! Stay tuned for more!
