# The future (or present?) of search: conversational search

Looking back at my first two months, it sometimes feels conflicting. On the one hand, no 'big' things have happened and I did not feel like I made much impact. However, reflecting objectively, the two months were quite busy! [I have started my first job ánd a PhD](/thoughts/20250929-starting-phd-journey). After a month, [I got detached to the RIVM](/thoughts/20251006-starting-at-rivm), going through the onboarding and meeting new colleagues again. I visited several networking events and conferences, the highlights being [the UvA Thesis Fair](/thoughts/20251017-thesis-fair), [DIR2025](/thoughts/20251027-dir2025), a ["Democracy Accelerator" ideathon](/thoughts/20251002-ideathon-democracy-accelerator) and a [hackaton](/thoughts/20251101-hackaton-woo). Sometimes, it was hard to find time to spent on my research and making time for it and saying no to events, drinks and meetings is going to be a learning point in the coming months.

Fortunately, I did manage to narrow the broad scope of information retrieval down to something exciting and highly relevant! Recent developments in the area of ‘generative AI’ (think of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT) are also changing the way we search. Instead of a list of relevant documents based on a few keywords, new technologies offer the possibility of directly generating an answer in natural language. A relevant area of research that I want to focus on in my study is ‘conversational search’. The goal is to make the search experience feel like a real conversation. For this, a chatbot can, for example, try to ask clarifying questions to better understand the user's search intent. A subsequent step is to provide an answer, based on the available documents, that is grounded in those documents (in natural language, RAG, Retrieval Augmented Generation, for the experts). I like to call this change the "search of the future" for the government (one could argue that this is already the present way of searching, although the governmental domain brings in lots of interesting research questions).

I like to divide conversational search into three pillars:
- Query reformulation: the context of the whole conversation needs to be used to formulate a complete query for retrieval
- Search clarification: to narrow down the search intent of the user, the chatbot needs to generate clarifying questions. A classic example for the ambiguous query "apple": "Are you looking for information on the fruit or the technology brand?"
- Conversational retrieval: to give the best answer to the user, efficient retrieval must be in place. This can be hard because of ambiguous queries, context switches. Also, how can we cite the documents that the answer is based on and battle hallucination?

Just for fun: I asked Google's Gemini Imagen model how users will search for information in the future and got this (slightly disturbing) image, which I will probably not achieve within 6 years:
