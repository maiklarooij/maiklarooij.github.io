# First external assignment: RIVM!

As part of my job as 'I-Adviseur' (information advisor) I can get matched to other organisations seeking help with their information keeping challenges. For me, this happened really fast, already after my first month. The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) needs help with the 'active' publishing of information as the Wet open overheid (Woo) demands. This seems like a really good match, as I have been working with the Woo over the past few years and the RIVM is a scientific institute and the knowledge of the scientific publishing process comes in handy here.

I'm excited about this new role, although it also means that I (again) have to meet a lot of new colleagues, which I also have been doing the past month.

## What is the 'active' publication of information?

The Woo demands two types of information disclosure:
- 'Passive' disclosure: on request, every citizen has the right to file an information (Woo)-request which the governmental body needs to answer
- 'Active' disclosure: pro-active publication of information (no one asked for it). There are 17 categories of information that need to be disclosed 'actively', as well as a 'best efforts obligation' (inspanningsverplichting) for other policy information

At the RIVM, they are currently wondering 1) what information needs to be disclosed (best efforts obligation), this is a trade-off between public interest and the effort needed to publish, 2) how does this process look like and 3) on which platforms this information will be disclosed.
